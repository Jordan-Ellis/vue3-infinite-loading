# Introduction

Light and simple infinite scroll component compatible with vue.js 3 and vite, to help you implement an infinite scroll list more easily.

## How it works

The component fires an `infinite` event when the user scrolls to the bottom or while the component is visible in the viewport of the `target` element passed as prop.

## Contribute

If you find any spelling mistakes or have improvements to offer, I am open to anyone who has ideas and wants to contribute.
